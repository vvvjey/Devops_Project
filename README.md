# **E-Commerce Order Management System**

This repository showcases a comprehensive **E-Commerce Order Management System** with robust scalability, high availability, and modern DevOps practices. The project focuses on **seamless order processing during peak traffic**, while ensuring no orders are lost, maintaining order consistency, and enabling future expansion.

---

## **Project Highlights**

### **1. CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins**
- Automated pipeline integrated with:
  - **SonarQube:** Static code analysis for identifying bugs and vulnerabilities.
  - **Snyk:** Security checks to detect dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
  - **Postman Tests:** Automated API testing to ensure endpoint reliability.
  - **Docker Hub:** Containerized application deployment.
  - **Kubernetes Deployment:** Continuous delivery to Kubernetes clusters.

### **2. Canary Deployment Strategy**
- Implemented using **Argo Rollouts** on **DigitalOcean Kubernetes**:
  - Enables gradual rollout of updates to production.
  - Monitors system performance and rollback if necessary.
  - Ensures minimal downtime and improved user experience.

### **3. Kafka Cluster for Peak Traffic Order Processing**
- Hosted on **Kubernetes** with **Autoscaler** to handle fluctuating loads during peak times.
- **Core Features of Kafka Cluster:**
  - **Reliable Order Processing:** Guarantees no orders are lost.
  - **Synchronized Processing:** Processes orders sequentially for consistency.
  - **Scalable Architecture:** Supports future expansions by adding more partitions or consumers.
  - **High Availability:** Deployed across Kubernetes with redundancy to ensure fault tolerance.

## **Architecture Overview**

The system is divided into three key components:

1. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Automates the build, test, and deployment process.
   - Ensures code quality and security through SonarQube and Snyk.
   - Uses Docker Hub to build and store images for Kubernetes deployment.

2. **Canary Deployment:**
   - Gradually deploys new versions of the application with Argo Rollouts.
   - Monitors real-time performance to detect and rollback faulty releases.

3. **Kafka Cluster for Order Management:**
   - Acts as the core messaging system for handling order requests.
   - Handles **order validation**, **status updates**, and **notification dispatch**.
   - Ensures all orders are processed **sequentially**, avoiding duplicates or data loss.
